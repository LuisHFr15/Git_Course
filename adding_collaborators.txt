Imagine the following situation: you have a repository, like this one, and you're going to
work with a friend, a co-worker, it doesn't matter right now who's going to work with you.
So, you have many files, and your repository is public, your co-worker can clone the repository,
do some modifies in some files, but it can't push it to the repository, why?
Because you need to add collaborators to your repository!

You can do it on GitHub, in the repository settings, add collaborators and send a invite!
With the git log command you can see the commits' historic, who did and what did, that's why
commits messages are so important!
