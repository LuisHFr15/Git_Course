Now, imagine that you're working on a project with many people, and at a certain time,
someone says that the project should go back to the beginning, where it was just few functions.
For this, there's the git log and the git revert id command, you can use git log to get the
id of the commit which you want to go back. It don't delete the changes!! It just create a new
commit to say that a revert has been made, so you can work freely and without problems if
you want to go back to the advanced moment of the project.
