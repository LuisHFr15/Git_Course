Now, what if I want to delete a commit?...

To do this, the command git reset --hard id, so you get back to this point and delete EVERYTHING
that was did after this commit (use it carefuly)

Now, what if I want to change the last commit? git reset is also the command, but with the 
--ammend -m "msg" to change the message
